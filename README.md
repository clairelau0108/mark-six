# Background Information
Mark Six is a lottery betting organized by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, and it is a lottery-style game where players guess what numbers will be drawn out of lottery machine. The lottery machine is a transparent plastic cylinder which contains color Red, Blue and Green balls with numbers 1 to 49. The cylinder is rotated to provide randomization in the drawing process. 
# Program Design Rationale
1. Mark Six is a famous game in Hong Kong, and many people are crazy about it.
2. Having a deeper understanding of week-02 I have learned, and applying the random syntax to a simple program.
# Program Procedures
1.	Using python3 to execute the file called **lucky.py**
2.	Firstly, the screen will show 6 random numbers, and they are from the integer 1-49, and the numbers are *non-repetitive*.
3.	Secondly, the screen will show another number from the remaining numbers, which is called **special number** in Mark Six. 
    * Because for the **special number**, sequence is very important (the 7th number). Under this situation, it is different from showing 7 numbers in the screen randomly. Therefore, with my friend’s help, I designed 2 lists. Please refer to the python.
